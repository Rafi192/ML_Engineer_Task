------------------Resume Categorization------------------

Steps to run the program-
1. Downlaoding the dataset from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset
And also, Download or clone the repository .

2.Installing dependencies using pip/peotry(For windows):
pip install Wordcloud
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
pip install re
pip install scikit-learn

For google colab:
!pip install Wordcloud
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install seaborn
!pip install re

3. For running the Script from command line, use this command:
python main.py "D:\Resume_classification\Resume\Project\APPAREL" 

" "=any specific directory that holds the resumes

4. The program Can also be run via google colab(without the main.py script),
Here you will find from importing necessary libraries to Training and evaluation of models.

--Just click on open in colab from the google colab link in the repository.
--The colab is great for having look into the data visualization and preprocessing.

***********************
----Pre processing and feature extration techniques are elaborated along with the code in the google colab file.
Nevertheless, I have used tfIdVectrozer method, which is a better feature extraction technique that countVectorizer,
as it emphasizes on importance of words. 
--Also, Most of the data cleansing were done using regular expression.
--Moreover, word tokenization and removal of stop words were also implemented to prepare the dataset for training.

Rationale behind chosing the model---

I used differnt classical Machine learning models for training such as SVM, Logistic regression, Decision tree,
as well as Random forest to classifiy resumes.

As it is a multiclass classification, SVM is good option and it scored better than other in the training.
SVM is also effective in high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for text data.
